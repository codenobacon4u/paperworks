# Paperworks
A game engine created in C++

Based off the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel) by Yan Chernikov created in his [Game Engine tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxIZbV_XjAs&list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT).

Current Changes I'm Working on:
------
* Rendering API using the Vulkan API as a backend
* Possible network connections using a networking API
* Build editor layout using Dear ImGui
